## Coding Quiz

# Program Description

This program is a quiz that goes through 5 basic coding questions. When the user opens the page, they are presented with the option to start or view high scores. When they start the quiz, a timer appears. For every question answered incorrectly, the timer subtracts 10 seconds. For every question correctly answered, the timer remains unchanged, and a point is added to the user's score. Once the user completes the quiz, or the timer reaches 0, they are presented with the results page. The user is then prompted to save their score. Once the user's score is saved, it will appear below in the scores section. The user may refresh the page and click the "view scores" button at the top left to view previous scores.
